## Context Description
Dialogue is a fundamental aspect of our social lives. Beyond its role in transmitting information, it significantly contributes to our mental health by stimulating our minds and helping us structure ideas into convincing arguments. To support socially isolated individuals in maintaining good mental health, we are developing a conversational agent capable of engaging in debates with humans.

## Objective
Our objective is to analyze the available literature on creating conversational agents capable of debating topics with humans.

## Requested Work
We require a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in conversational agents capable of debating. The review should cover the following subjects:

- **What is a debate? What constitutes a good debate?**
- **What debating techniques exist, and how can they be employed in a conversational agent?**
- **What are the existing types of conversational agents capable of debating a subject?**
